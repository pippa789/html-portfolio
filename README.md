This is a first attemp to create a landing page with simple call to actions, an interresting banner or hero image and the relevent information laid out in an 
accessable way.

I tried to use CSS grid which I think would be a more elegant way to achieve the layout I wanted, but found it difficult and I'll need more practice. I will try to master it in future because it is better than manipulating components with negative margins which I feel might look unprofessional even if it is within a flexbox block.

I enjoyed using a combinator for both granular controle and a dryer CSS file but found it's scope caused some unexpected results when using it to refactor an element. When I use one in future I will create the element with it's use in mind. 

In conclusion I did not master all the tools I wanted to but enjoyed the process and look forward to improving.
